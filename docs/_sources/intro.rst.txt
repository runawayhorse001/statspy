Sphnix: Python Documentation Generator
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following descriptions are from `Sphinx`_:

`Sphinx`_ is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation, written by Georg Brandl and licensed under the BSD license.

It was originally created for the Python documentation, and it has excellent facilities for the documentation of software projects in a range of languages. Of course, this site is also created from reStructuredText sources using Sphinx! The following features should be highlighted:

* **Output formats:** ``HTML`` (including Windows HTML Help), ``LaTeX`` (for printable PDF versions), ePub, Texinfo, manual pages, plain text

* **Extensive cross-references:** semantic markup and automatic links for functions, classes, citations, glossary terms and similar pieces of information

* **Hierarchical structure:** easy definition of a document tree, with automatic links to siblings, parents and children

* **Automatic indices:** general index as well as a language-specific module indices

* **Code handling:** automatic highlighting using the Pygments highlighter

* **Extensions:** automatic testing of code snippets, inclusion of docstrings from Python modules (API docs), and more

* **Contributed extensions:** more than 50 extensions contributed by users in a second repository; most of them installable from PyPI

Sphinx uses `reStructuredText`_ as its markup language, and many of its strengths come from the power and straightforwardness of reStructuredText and its parsing and translating suite, the Docutils.

reStructured Text
+++++++++++++++++

The following descriptions are from `reStructuredText`_:

`reStructuredText`_ (RST, ReST, or reST) is a file format for textual data used primarily in the Python programming language community for technical documentation.


Latex Document Preparation System
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following descriptions are from `LaTex`_:

`LaTeX`_ (a shortening of Lamport ``TeX``) is a document preparation system. When writing, the writer uses plain text as opposed to the formatted text found in WYSIWYG ("what you see is what you get") word processors like Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer and Apple Pages. 

LaTeX is widely used in academia for the communication and publication of scientific documents in many fields, including mathematics, statistics, computer science, engineering, chemistry, physics, economics, linguistics, quantitative psychology, philosophy, and political science.
