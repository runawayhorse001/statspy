I would refer the reader to [Sphinx2019]_ and [Georg2018]_ for more details.

Sections
--------

Sections are identified through their titles, which are marked up with adornment: "underlines" below the title text, or underlines and matching "overlines" above the title. More details can be found at: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#sections

reStructuredText:

.. code-block:: rst

	------------------


Paragraphs
----------

The paragraph is the most basic block in a reST document. 
Paragraphs are simply chunks of text separated by one or 
more blank lines. As in Python, indentation is significant 
in reST, so all lines of the same paragraph must be 
left-aligned to the **same level of indentation**. More 
details can be found at: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#paragraphs

1. **General Paragraphs**

reStructuredText:

.. code-block:: rst

	This is the first demo paragraph. The blank line above 
	the first line is required; The blank line below the last
	line is required. 

	This is the second demo paragraph. The blank line above 
	the first line is required; The blank line below the last
	line is required. 

Syntax diagram:

.. code-block:: rst

	+------------------------------+
	| paragraph                    |
	|                              |
	+------------------------------+

	|                              |
	+------------------------------+


Result:

This is the first demo paragraph. The blank line above the first 
line is required; The blank line below the last line is required. 

This is the second demo paragraph. The blank line above the first 
line is required; The blank line below the last line is required. 

2. **Bullet Lists Paragraphs**


reStructuredText:

.. code-block:: rst

	- This is the first bullet list item.  The blank line above the
	  first list item is required; blank lines between list items
	  (such as below this paragraph) are optional.

	- This is the first paragraph in the second item in the list.

	  This is the second paragraph in the second item in the list.
	  The blank line above this paragraph is required.  The left edge
	  of this paragraph lines up with the paragraph above, both
	  indented relative to the bullet.

	  - This is a sublist.  The bullet lines up with the left edge of
	    the text blocks above.  A sublist is a new list so requires a
	    blank line above and below.

	  - This is a sublist.  The bullet lines up with the left edge of
        the text blocks above.  A sublist is a new list so requires a
        blank line above and below.    

	- This is the third item of the main list.

	This paragraph is not part of the list.

Math
----

The math role marks its content as mathematical notation (inline formula). More details can be found at: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/es/stable/ext/math.html.

The input language for mathematics is LaTeX markup. I will not do a LaTex tutorial as here. 

1. **Inline formula**

reStructuredText:

.. code-block:: rst

	The area of a circle is :math:`A_\text{c} = (\pi/4) d^2`.

RFesult:

The area of a circle is :math:`A_\text{c} = (\pi/4) d^2`.

2. **Equations**

reStructuredText:

.. code-block:: rst

	.. math::
	   :label: eq_lin_cost_func

	   \min _{\beta\in \mathbb {R} ^{p}}{\frac {1}{n}}\|{\hat {X}}\beta-{\hat {Y}}\|^{2}

    The equation :eq:`eq_lin_cost_func` is the cost function for linear regression.

Result:

.. math::
   :label: eq_cost_function

   \min _{\beta\in \mathbb {R} ^{p}}{\frac {1}{n}}\|{\hat {X}}\beta-{\hat {Y}}\|^{2}

The equation :eq:`eq_cost_function` is the cost function for linear regression.

3. **User defined symbol and equation**

Add your definitions to the ``latex_elements['preamble']`` and ``imgmath_latex_preamble``, then you can apply your own notations for symbol and equtions. 

my definitions for :math:`\B` symbol and :math:`\euler` equation: 

.. code-block:: latex

   '\\def\\B{{\\bf \\mathcal B}}\n'+ \
   '\\def\\euler{\ e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0}\n'


reStructuredText:

.. code-block:: rst


	The is a test for the user defined math symbol: :math:`\B`.

	The is a test for the user defined math equation: 

	.. math:: 

		\euler

The is a test for the user defined math symbol: :math:`\B`.

The is a test for the user defined math equation: 

.. math:: 

	\euler

4. **More examples** 

reStructuredText:

	.. math::

		f(x)
		=
		\Biggl \lbrace
		{

		   { x >0}

	.. math::

	   (a + b)^2  &=  (a + b)(a + b) \\
	              &=  a^2 + 2ab + b^2
	              
	.. math::

	   \begin{eqnarray}
	      y    & = & ax^2 + bx + c \nonumber\\
	      f(x) & = & x^2 + 2xy + y^2\nonumber
	   \end{eqnarray}
	   
	.. math:: e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
	   :label: euler

Result:

.. math::

	f(x)
	=
	\Biggl \lbrace
	{
	0,\text{ if }
	   { x >0}
	\atop
	1 \text{ otherwise }
	}

.. math::

   (a + b)^2  &=  (a + b)(a + b) \\
              &=  a^2 + 2ab + b^2

	    <iframe width="700" height="315" 
	    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mrEee4bhc7Y" 
	    frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Roles
+++++

A role or “custom interpreted text role” is an inline piece of explicit markup. It signifies that that the enclosed text should be interpreted in a specific way. Sphinx uses this to provide semantic markup and cross-referencing of identifiers, as described in the appropriate section. More details can be found at: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/roles.html#customization


Standard Roles
--------------

* **Line markup**

reStructuredText:

.. code-block:: rst

	* emphasis – equivalent of *emphasis*

	* strong – equivalent of **strong**

	* literal – equivalent of ``literal``

	* subscript – H\ :sub:`2`\ O

	* superscript – E = mc\ :sup:`2`

	* title-reference – for titles of books, periodicals, and other materials

Result:

* emphasis – equivalent of *emphasis*

* strong – equivalent of **strong**

* literal – equivalent of ``literal``

* subscript – H\ :sub:`2`\ O

* superscript – E = mc\ :sup:`2`

* title-reference – for titles of books, periodicals, and other materials


Specialized Roles
-----------------

* **raw**

reStructuredText:

.. code-block:: rst

	.. raw:: html

	    <iframe width="700" height="315" 
	    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Mg8QD0F1dQ" 
	    frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Result:

.. raw:: html

    <iframe width="700" height="315" 
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Mg8QD0F1dQ" 
    frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

reStructuredText:

.. code-block:: rst

	.. role:: raw-html(raw)
	   :format: html

	If there just *has* to be a line break here,
	:raw-html:`<br />`
	it can be accomplished with a "raw"-derived role.
	But the line block syntax should be considered first.

Result:

.. role:: raw-html(raw)
   :format: html

If there just *has* to be a line break here,
:raw-html:`<br />`
it can be accomplished with a "raw"-derived role.
But the line block syntax should be considered first.

* **replace**

reStructuredText:

.. code-block:: rst

	.. |sphx| replace:: Sphinx 
	.. |reST| replace:: reStructuredText

	|reST| is awesome!

.. |sphx| replace:: Sphinx 
.. |reST| replace:: reStructuredText

|sphx| and |reST| are awesome!



Directives
++++++++++

A directive is a generic block of explicit markup. Along with roles, it is one of the extension mechanisms of reST, and Sphinx makes heavy use of it.

Admonitions
-----------

Admonitions: ``attention``, ``caution``, ``danger``, ``error``, ``hint``, ``important``, ``note``, ``tip``, ``warning``

* **attention**

reStructuredText:

.. code-block:: rst

	.. attention::

	   You neen to pay attention at here!

Result:

.. attention::

   You neen to pay attention at here!

* **caution**

reStructuredText:

.. code-block:: rst

	.. caution::

	   This is a caution alert!

Restlut:

.. caution::

	This is a caution alert!

* **important**

reStructuredText:

.. code-block:: rst

	.. important:: 

		This is important!

Result:

.. important:: 

	This is important!

*  **User defined admonition**

reStructuredText:

.. code-block:: rst

	.. admonition:: User defined name

	   You can make up your own admonition too.

Result:

.. admonition:: User defined name

   You can make up your own admonition too.

* **seealso**

reStructuredText:

.. code-block:: rst

	.. seealso::

	   The authoritative `reStructuredText User Documentation
	   <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_.  The "ref" links in this
	   document link to the description of the individual constructs in the reST
	   reference.
